        <h2>1.7 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
        <p class="indent">The DecorHome project follows the Waterfall model of software development, characterized by
            sequential phases where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This structured approach
            ensures thorough planning and documentation at each stage.</p>

        <div class="diagram-box">
            <strong>SDLC Phases</strong><br><br>
            Requirements Analysis → System Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 1: Requirements Analysis</h3>
        <p class="indent">The initial phase involves comprehensive requirement gathering and analysis. This includes
            identifying all functional requirements (features the system must provide) and non-functional requirements
            (performance, usability, compatibility constraints). User roles are defined—customers who browse and
            purchase products, and administrators who manage the system. Technical constraints and limitations are
            documented to establish realistic project boundaries.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2: System Design</h3>
        <p class="indent">System design translates requirements into technical specifications. The application
            architecture is planned, including the organization of HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript modules.
            Although DecorHome uses client-side storage rather than a traditional database, a conceptual data model is
            designed to structure information logically. User interface mockups and wireframes are created to visualize
            the final product. Technology selection is finalized with justifications for each choice.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Implementation</h3>
        <p class="indent">Implementation involves actual coding and development work. HTML structures are created for
            all pages, CSS styling is applied to achieve the desired visual design, and JavaScript functionality is
            implemented to provide interactivity and business logic. The development progresses iteratively, with
            individual components built and integrated systematically.</p>

        <h3>Phase 4: Testing</h3>
        <p class="indent">Rigorous testing ensures the application functions correctly and meets requirements. Unit
            testing verifies individual components, integration testing confirms components work together properly, and
            user acceptance testing validates that the system meets user needs. Cross-browser testing ensures
            compatibility across different browsers and devices. Bugs discovered during testing are documented and
            resolved.</p>

        <h3>Phase 5: Deployment</h3>
        <p class="indent">Deployment prepares the application for production use. Code is optimized for performance,
            including minification of JavaScript and CSS files. Comprehensive documentation is prepared covering
            installation procedures, usage instructions, and maintenance guidelines. The application is deployed to a
            hosting environment and final performance checks are conducted.</p>

        <h3>Phase 6: Maintenance</h3>
        <p class="indent">Post-deployment maintenance ensures continued operation and improvement. This includes
            monitoring for bugs and issues, implementing fixes as needed, gathering user feedback for potential
            enhancements, optimizing performance based on real-world usage patterns, and applying security updates to
            address vulnerabilities. Maintenance is an ongoing process throughout the application's lifecycle.</p>

        <div class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 2<br>PROPOSED METHODOLOGY</div>

        <h2>2.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p class="indent">The development methodology for DecorHome centers on creating a robust e-commerce platform
            through systematic application of front-end web technologies. This chapter details the structured approach
            adopted throughout the project lifecycle, explaining the reasoning behind architectural choices and
            technology selections that shape the final implementation.</p>

        <p class="indent">Our approach prioritizes user-centered design principles while maintaining modular development
            practices. This dual focus ensures the application remains maintainable and scalable while delivering an
            exceptional user experience. The implementation adheres to established web development standards and
            incorporates contemporary features including responsive layouts, client-side data persistence, and rich
            interactive interfaces that respond intuitively to user actions.</p>

        <h2>2.2 System</h2>
        <p class="indent">DecorHome operates as a client-side web application, leveraging browser capabilities to
            deliver a complete e-commerce experience. The system architecture reflects careful consideration of
            performance, user experience, and development efficiency.</p>

        <h3>System Architecture:</h3>
        <p class="indent">The application implements a three-tier architectural pattern that separates concerns and
            facilitates organized development. The presentation layer utilizes HTML for semantic content structure, CSS
            for comprehensive styling and visual presentation, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. The business
            logic layer consists of JavaScript modules that encapsulate specific functionality and maintain clean code
            organization. The data layer employs browser storage mechanisms—localStorage for persistent information that
            survives browser sessions, and sessionStorage for temporary data that exists only during active sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>Core Components:</h3>
        <p class="indent">The system builds upon a foundation of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deliberately
            avoiding external frameworks to demonstrate fundamental web development principles. A mobile-first
            responsive design strategy ensures optimal display across devices of varying screen sizes. Client-side
            storage mechanisms handle data persistence, with localStorage maintaining shopping cart contents and user
            preferences across sessions, while sessionStorage manages temporary authentication tokens and
            session-specific information.</p>

        <p class="indent">Navigation follows a multi-page architecture where each page represents a distinct section of
            the application. UI components maintain visual and functional consistency through a unified design language,
            with reusable elements such as buttons, forms, and product cards sharing common styling and behavior
            patterns.</p>

        <h3>System Features:</h3>
        <p class="indent">User authentication and session management provide secure access control, allowing users to
            create accounts, log in, and maintain persistent sessions. The product catalog organizes items into logical
            categories, supporting browsing and filtering operations. Shopping cart functionality offers complete
            control over purchase selections, including item addition, removal, and quantity adjustment, with cart
            contents persisting across browsing sessions.</p>

        <p class="indent">The order processing workflow guides users through checkout steps, collecting necessary
            billing and shipping information. An administrative dashboard provides authorized users with tools to manage
            products, view orders, and monitor system activity. Throughout the application, responsive design ensures
            consistent functionality across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>2.3 Disadvantages</h2>
        <p class="indent">While the chosen methodology offers numerous benefits for learning and demonstration purposes,
            honest assessment requires acknowledging inherent limitations that affect system capabilities and practical
            deployment scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Technical Limitations:</h3>
        <p class="indent">The application executes entirely within the browser environment, lacking server-side
            processing capabilities that would enable advanced features like real-time inventory management or secure
            payment processing. Data persistence relies solely on browser storage mechanisms, meaning users risk data
            loss when clearing browser cache or switching devices. Security implementations remain basic, with sensitive
            operations like payment processing only simulated rather than connected to actual payment gateways.</p>

        <p class="indent">Performance considerations arise when handling large datasets, as all processing occurs
            client-side without database optimization or server-side caching. The application depends on modern browser
            APIs that may not function properly in older browser versions, potentially limiting accessibility for some
            users.</p>

        <h3>Functional Limitations:</h3>
        <p class="indent">Without backend infrastructure, the system cannot provide real-time updates across multiple
            devices or synchronize shopping carts when users switch browsers. User authentication implements simplified
            logic without robust password encryption or multi-factor authentication, making it unsuitable for production
            environments handling sensitive data.</p>

        <p class="indent">Payment processing remains entirely simulated, with no integration to actual payment
            processors or financial institutions. Product information exists as static content within the codebase
            rather than being dynamically loaded from databases, complicating content updates. Similarly, inventory
            tracking cannot validate stock availability or prevent overselling, as these features require backend
            database systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h3>Development Constraints:</h3>
        <p class="indent">Content updates require manual code modifications and redeployment rather than administrative
            interface updates, increasing maintenance overhead. Testing client-side interactions proves challenging to
            automate effectively, often requiring manual testing procedures. Large JavaScript files can impact initial
            page load times, particularly on slower network connections, though this can be mitigated through code
            optimization and minification techniques. Different browser implementations may produce inconsistent
            behavior or appearance, necessitating comprehensive cross-browser testing.</p>

        <h2>2.4 Proposed Structure</h2>
        <p class="indent">DecorHome's organizational structure follows modular design principles, separating
            functionality into logical components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This
            structure promotes code reusability, simplifies debugging, and facilitates future enhancements.</p>

        <h3>Module Organization:</h3>
        <p class="indent">The codebase divides into seven primary modules, each handling specific aspects of application
            functionality. The Core Module manages application initialization, routing between pages, and global state
            management. The UI Module contains reusable interface components and handles user interactions with buttons,
            forms, and other interactive elements.</p>

        <p class="indent">The Data Module abstracts all client-side storage operations, providing consistent interfaces
            for reading and writing data to localStorage and sessionStorage. The Authentication Module implements user
            login, registration, and session management logic. The Cart Module handles all shopping cart operations
            including adding items, updating quantities, calculating totals, and persisting cart state.</p>

        <p class="indent">The Product Module manages product display, filtering, searching, and detailed product views.
            Finally, the Admin Module provides administrative functionality for managing products, viewing orders, and
            accessing customer information through a dedicated dashboard interface.</p>

        <h2>3.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p class="indent">Structured analysis represents a fundamental approach in software engineering that
            systematically decomposes complex systems into comprehensible, manageable components. This analytical
            methodology enables developers and stakeholders to understand system requirements, interactions, and data
            relationships through visual modeling techniques. For the DecorHome project, structured analysis provides
            clarity regarding system functionality, user interactions, process flows, and data architecture.</p>

        <p class="indent">This chapter presents comprehensive system analysis through multiple modeling perspectives.
            Use case diagrams illustrate functional requirements and actor interactions. Activity diagrams map process
            workflows and decision points. Sequence diagrams detail temporal interactions between system components.
            Entity-relationship diagrams define data structures and relationships. Together, these models create a
            complete picture of the DecorHome system architecture and behavior.</p>

        <h3>3.1.1 Use Case Diagram</h3>
        <p class="indent">The use case diagram provides a high-level view of system functionality and the actors who
            interact with these functions. For DecorHome, we identify two primary actors with distinct roles and
            capabilities. Customers represent end-users who browse products, manage shopping carts, and complete
            purchases. Administrators maintain system content, manage orders, and oversee user accounts. Understanding
            these actor roles and their associated use cases establishes the foundation for functional requirements.</p>

        <p class="indent">Customers interact with seven primary use cases covering the complete shopping experience.
            Browsing the catalog allows customers to explore available products organized by category. Product search
            functionality enables targeted discovery based on keywords or filters. Viewing product details provides
            comprehensive information including descriptions, specifications, pricing, and images. Cart management lets
            customers add items, adjust quantities, and remove products before purchase. Order processing guides
            customers through checkout, collecting billing and shipping information. User authentication secures
            accounts through login and registration. Profile management allows customers to update personal information
            and view order history.</p>

        <p class="indent">Administrators access five specialized use cases for system management. Product management
            encompasses adding new products, editing existing items, and removing discontinued products. Order
            management provides visibility into customer orders with capabilities to update order status and handle
            cancellations. User management gives administrators tools to view customer accounts and address
            account-related issues. Analytics deliver insights into sales performance, popular products, and customer
            behavior. System settings allow configuration of platform parameters and preferences.</p>

        <h3>3.1.2 Use Case Relationships Diagram</h3>
        <p class="indent">While the basic use case diagram shows actor-to-function relationships, the use case
            relationships diagram reveals how different functionalities interconnect and depend upon each other. These
            relationships demonstrate system flow and logical dependencies between operations.</p>

        <p class="indent">The shopping workflow begins with catalog browsing, progressing through product selection,
            cart management, and culminating in order placement. Each step builds upon previous actions, creating a
            logical flow that guides customers toward purchase completion. Authentication serves as an entry point
            enabling access to personalized features. Profile management provides supporting functionality that enhances
            the overall user experience without being part of the primary shopping flow.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="indent">The activity diagram illustrates decision points throughout the shopping journey. After
            viewing product details, customers decide whether to add items to their cart or continue browsing. Once
            items are added, customers choose between continued shopping or proceeding to cart review. During cart
            review, customers may modify quantities or proceed to checkout. Finally, during order review, customers can
            confirm the purchase or return to modify their cart. This flexibility accommodates varying customer
            preferences and shopping patterns.</p>

        <h3>3.1.4 Sequence Diagram</h3>
        <p class="indent">Sequence diagrams capture the time-ordered interaction between objects or components within
            the system. They illustrate how processes operate with one another and in what order, making them
            particularly valuable for understanding complex interactions.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="indent">The sequence diagram for adding items to the cart demonstrates interaction between four key
            components. When users click the "Add to Cart" button, the user interface receives this input and forwards
            it to the cart controller. The controller retrieves current cart contents from storage, determines whether
            the product already exists in the cart, updates the cart accordingly, saves the modified cart back to
            storage, and finally instructs the user interface to update the display. This sequence ensures data
            consistency and provides appropriate user feedback.</p>

        <h3>3.1.5 Registration Process</h3>
        <p class="indent">User registration establishes new accounts within the DecorHome system. This process involves
            data validation, duplicate checking, and account creation with appropriate security measures.</p>

        <p class="indent">The data flow diagram identifies key system components and their interactions. External
            entities (customers and administrators) interact with the system through the user interface. Four primary
            processes handle different aspects of functionality: authentication validates user credentials, product
            management maintains the product catalog, order processing handles purchases, and cart management tracks
            shopping selections. Each process connects to appropriate data stores, reading existing data and writing
            updates as needed. Supporting processes like inventory management and payment processing integrate with
            primary workflows.</p>

        <h3>3.4.1 Login Process Data Flow</h3>
        <p class="indent">The login process represents a critical security checkpoint where user credentials are
            validated against stored account information. This data flow ensures only authorized users access protected
            features.</p>

        <p class="indent">Login data flow begins when users submit credentials through the login page. The system first
            validates input format to ensure fields contain appropriate data types and lengths. If format validation
            passes, the authentication process queries the user database to verify credentials. Invalid credentials
            result in error messages prompting users to retry. Valid credentials trigger session creation, granting
            access to protected areas of the application.</p>

        <h3>3.4.2 Registration Process Data Flow</h3>
        <p class="indent">User registration creates new accounts by collecting personal information, validating data,
            checking for duplicates, and storing account details securely.</p>

        <p class="indent">Registration data flow validates submitted information against format requirements and
            business rules. The system checks the user database for existing accounts with the same email address to
            prevent duplicates. Passing all validation checks allows account creation, storing user information
            securely. A welcome email confirms successful registration, and users are directed to the login page to
            access their new account.</p>

        <div class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 4<br>BASIC STRUCTURE</div>

        <h2>4.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p class="indent">The architectural foundation of DecorHome rests upon three fundamental web technologies that
            have defined web development for decades: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies work in concert to
            deliver a complete e-commerce experience, each contributing distinct capabilities that address different
            aspects of application functionality. Understanding how these technologies integrate and support one another
            provides essential insight into the project's construction and operation.</p>

        <p class="indent">DecorHome adopts a client-side architecture that executes entirely within the user's browser
            environment. This approach offers several advantages including immediate deployment without server
            infrastructure, simplified development workflow, and direct user interaction without network latency for
            most operations. HTML provides semantic content structure and accessibility features. CSS delivers
            sophisticated visual presentation and responsive layouts. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity and data
            management. Together, these technologies create a cohesive platform that functions reliably across diverse
            browsers and devices.</p>

        <h2>4.2 Technology Stack</h2>
        <p class="indent">The DecorHome platform employs specific versions and features of each core technology,
            carefully selected to balance modern capabilities with broad browser compatibility. Each technology
            contributes unique strengths to the overall system architecture.</p>

        <h3>4.2.1 HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
        <p class="indent">HTML5 serves as the structural foundation of DecorHome, providing the semantic framework upon
            which all content is organized. Unlike earlier HTML versions, HTML5 introduces meaningful elements that
            describe content purpose rather than mere presentation. This semantic approach improves search engine
            optimization, enhances accessibility for users with disabilities, and creates more maintainable code.</p>

        <h4>Semantic Elements Implementation</h4>
        <p class="indent">The project employs HTML5 semantic elements throughout its structure. The header element
            contains site branding and primary navigation, establishing consistent presence across all pages. The nav
            element groups navigation links, helping assistive technologies identify navigation regions. The main
            element wraps primary page content, distinguishing it from ancillary information. Section elements organize
            related content into thematic groups. Article elements contain self-contained compositions like product
            listings. The footer element holds supplementary information including contact details and copyright
            notices.</p>

        <h4>Form Enhancements</h4>
        <p class="indent">HTML5 form improvements significantly enhance user experience and data validation. New input
            types like email automatically validate email address format, reducing errors and simplifying JavaScript
            validation logic. The tel input type optimizes mobile keyboards for phone number entry. Number inputs
            provide appropriate controls for numeric data. Date inputs offer calendar pickers on supporting browsers.
            These enhancements work seamlessly with HTML5 validation attributes including required fields, pattern
            matching, and length constraints.</p>

        <h4>Standard Document Structure</h4>
        <p class="indent">Every page in DecorHome follows consistent structural organization. The DOCTYPE declaration
            specifies HTML5 document type. The html element includes a lang attribute for language identification. The
            head section contains metadata, character encoding specification, viewport configuration for mobile devices,
            and stylesheet references. The body section houses visible content organized through semantic elements.
            Script tags appear at the document end to prevent blocking page rendering.</p>

        <h3>4.2.2 CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
        <p class="indent">CSS3 controls all visual aspects of DecorHome, from basic color schemes to complex animations.
            The project organizes styles into multiple focused stylesheets rather than one monolithic file, improving
            maintainability and performance through selective loading.</p>

        <h4>Layout Systems</h4>
        <p class="indent">Flexbox provides the primary layout mechanism for one-dimensional arrangements. Navigation
            bars use flexbox to distribute links evenly. Product cards arrange images and information vertically within
            flexible containers. Footer content aligns horizontally across available space. CSS Grid handles
            two-dimensional layouts where content must align both horizontally and vertically. Product galleries use
            grid layouts to create responsive arrangements that adapt based on available space.</p>

        <h4>Responsive Design Implementation</h4>
        <p class="indent">Media queries enable responsive behavior by applying different styles based on device
            characteristics. The mobile-first approach defines base styles for small screens, then progressively
            enhances for larger displays. Breakpoints at common device widths ensure optimal presentation on phones,
            tablets, and desktop computers. Flexible images scale proportionally within containers. Typography adjusts
            for readability across screen sizes.</p>

        <h4>Visual Effects and Animations</h4>
        <p class="indent">CSS transitions smooth property changes when users hover over interactive elements or trigger
            state changes. Transform properties create visual effects like scaling buttons on hover or rotating icons.
            Keyframe animations produce complex motion sequences for loading indicators and attention-drawing elements.
            These effects enhance user engagement without requiring JavaScript execution.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>4.2.3 JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="indent">JavaScript powers all dynamic functionality within DecorHome, managing user interactions,
            updating interface elements in response to actions, and handling data storage operations. The project uses
            vanilla JavaScript without external frameworks, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and browser
            API usage.</p>

        <h4>DOM Manipulation</h4>
        <p class="indent">The Document Object Model provides JavaScript access to HTML elements and their properties.
            DecorHome uses DOM manipulation to dynamically update content without page reloads. When users add products
            to their cart, JavaScript modifies the cart display immediately. Product filtering updates visible items
            based on selected categories. Form validation displays error messages inline with problematic fields.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h4>Event Handling</h4>
        <p class="indent">Event listeners enable response to user actions. Click events trigger when users interact with
            buttons, links, or other clickable elements. Submit events fire when forms are submitted, allowing
            validation before processing. Scroll events track page position for features like sticky navigation.
            Keyboard events enable shortcuts and accessibility features. This event-driven architecture creates
            responsive, interactive experiences.</p>

        <h4>Modern JavaScript Features</h4>
        <p class="indent">The project leverages contemporary JavaScript capabilities while maintaining broad browser
            compatibility. Arrow functions provide concise syntax for callback functions. Template literals simplify
            string concatenation and multiline strings. Destructuring extracts values from objects and arrays
            efficiently. The spread operator facilitates array and object manipulation. These features produce cleaner,
            more maintainable code.</p>

        <h4>Code Organization</h4>
        <p class="indent">JavaScript files organize functionality logically. The main script handles core application
            initialization, navigation management, and common utilities used throughout the site. Administrative
            functions reside in separate files loaded only on admin pages, reducing unnecessary code execution.
            Animation controllers manage timing and sequencing of visual effects. This modular organization improves
            code maintainability and enables selective loading for performance optimization.</p>

        <h2>4.3 Website Classification</h2>
        <p class="indent">DecorHome fits multiple website categories simultaneously, reflecting the diverse
            functionality it provides. Understanding these classifications clarifies the project's purpose and technical
            requirements.</p>

        <h3>4.3.1 E-commerce Platform</h3>
        <p class="indent">Primarily, DecorHome functions as a business-to-consumer e-commerce platform. Customers browse
            product catalogs, examine detailed product information, add items to shopping carts, and complete checkout
            processes. The platform represents a single-vendor marketplace where all products originate from one
            business entity. This differs from multi-vendor marketplaces like eBay or Etsy where multiple independent
            sellers list products.</p>

        <h3>4.3.2 Content Management System</h3>
        <p class="indent">The administrative interface provides content management capabilities allowing authorized
            users to maintain product information, manage orders, and configure system settings. While traditional
            content management systems store content in databases, DecorHome simulates these capabilities through
            client-side data structures and localStorage persistence.</p>

        <h3>4.3.3 Responsive Web Application</h3>
        <p class="indent">DecorHome exemplifies responsive web design principles, adapting its layout and functionality
            across diverse devices. The mobile-first development approach prioritizes smartphone experiences, then
            progressively enhances for tablets and desktop computers. This ensures usability regardless of how customers
            access the platform.</p>

        <h3>4.3.4 Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p class="indent">The application follows progressive enhancement philosophy, beginning with functional HTML
            that works without CSS or JavaScript, then layering visual enhancements through CSS and interactive features
            through JavaScript. This approach ensures basic functionality remains accessible even when advanced features
            are unavailable.</p>

        <h2>4.4 Client-Side Backend Simulation</h2>
        <p class="indent">While DecorHome lacks traditional server-side infrastructure, it simulates backend
            functionality through browser storage mechanisms and carefully structured JavaScript logic. This approach
            demonstrates complete e-commerce workflows without requiring server configuration or database installation.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4.1 Data Storage Mechanisms</h3>
        <p class="indent">Browser storage APIs provide persistence across page loads and browser sessions. localStorage
            maintains data indefinitely until explicitly cleared, making it suitable for shopping cart contents and user
            preferences. sessionStorage retains data only during active browser sessions, appropriate for authentication
            status and temporary information. Both APIs store data as strings, requiring JSON serialization for complex
            data structures.</p>

        <h4>Shopping Cart Implementation</h4>
        <p class="indent">The shopping cart demonstrates practical localStorage usage. When users add products,
            JavaScript creates objects containing product names, prices, and quantities. These objects populate an array
            representing the complete cart. This array undergoes JSON serialization before storage. Upon page load, the
            application retrieves the serialized cart data, parses it back into JavaScript objects, and reconstructs the
            cart display.</p>

        <div class="code-box">// Cart data structure
            const cartItem = {
            name: "Modern Table Lamp",
            price: 49.99,
            quantity: 1
            };

            // Saving cart to localStorage
            const cart = [cartItem];
            localStorage.setItem('decorhome-cart', JSON.stringify(cart));

            // Retrieving cart from localStorage
            const savedCart = localStorage.getItem('decorhome-cart');
            if (savedCart) {
            const cart = JSON.parse(savedCart);
            }</div>

        <h4>Session Management</h4>
        <p class="indent">User authentication leverages sessionStorage for temporary login state. When users
            successfully log in, the system stores authentication flags in sessionStorage. These flags persist across
            page navigation within the same browser tab but clear when the tab closes. This behavior mimics server-side
            session management while operating entirely client-side.</p>

        <div class="code-box">// Setting authentication state
            sessionStorage.setItem('userLoggedIn', 'true');
            sessionStorage.setItem('userName', 'Demo User');

            // Checking authentication
            if (sessionStorage.getItem('userLoggedIn') === 'true') {
            // Display user-specific content
            const userName = sessionStorage.getItem('userName');
            }</div>

        <h3>4.4.2 Authentication System</h3>
        <p class="indent">The authentication system validates user credentials against predefined values stored within
            the JavaScript code. While this approach lacks production-grade security, it effectively demonstrates
            authentication workflows for educational purposes.</p>

        <h4>Login Process</h4>
        <p class="indent">Users submit email addresses and passwords through login forms. JavaScript validates input
            format ensuring fields contain appropriate data. The system then compares submitted credentials against
            stored values. Matching credentials trigger session creation through sessionStorage, while mismatches
            produce error messages prompting retry attempts. Successful authentication redirects users to their account
            dashboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h4>Registration Process</h4>
        <p class="indent">Registration collects user information including name, email, password, and contact details.
            JavaScript validates each field according to defined rules—email format verification, password strength
            requirements, required field completion. The system simulates checking for existing accounts by examining
            localStorage for duplicate email addresses. Passing validation results in account creation with data stored
            in localStorage for future login attempts.</p>

        <h3>4.4.3 Product Management</h3>
        <p class="indent">Product information exists as static data embedded within HTML and JavaScript. While
            production e-commerce platforms store products in databases, DecorHome includes product details directly in
            code. This simplification eliminates database requirements while maintaining realistic product browsing
            experiences.</p>

        <h4>Product Display</h4>
        <p class="indent">Each product category has dedicated HTML pages containing product cards with images, names,
            descriptions, and prices. JavaScript enhances these static displays with interactive features like image
            galleries, quick view modals, and dynamic filtering. Users can sort products by price, filter by category,
            and search by keyword—all implemented through client-side JavaScript that shows or hides existing HTML
            elements.</p>

        <h4>Search Functionality</h4>
        <p class="indent">Product search operates entirely client-side by examining product names and descriptions for
            matches against user queries. JavaScript converts search terms and product text to lowercase for
            case-insensitive comparison. Matching products remain visible while non-matching items hide from view. This
            real-time filtering provides immediate feedback as users type search queries.</p>

        <h3>4.4.4 Order Processing</h3>
        <p class="indent">The checkout process guides users through order completion via multiple steps, collecting
            necessary information at each stage. While payment processing remains simulated, the workflow mirrors real
            e-commerce checkout experiences.</p>

        <h4>Cart Management</h4>
        <p class="indent">Cart operations modify the cart array stored in localStorage. Adding products either
            increments existing item quantities or appends new items to the array. Removing products filters them from
            the array. Quantity updates modify the appropriate array element. After each operation, JavaScript
            recalculates totals and persists the updated cart to localStorage. The cart display updates immediately to
            reflect changes.</p>

        <h4>Checkout Flow</h4>
        <p class="indent">Checkout begins with cart review where users verify their selections. The next step collects
            billing information including names, addresses, and contact details. Payment information entry follows,
            accepting simulated credit card details. A final review step displays the complete order before submission.
            Throughout this process, JavaScript validates each input field before allowing progression to subsequent
            steps. Order submission stores order details in localStorage for order history display.</p>

        <h3>4.4.5 Administrative Functions</h3>
        <p class="indent">The administrative dashboard provides management capabilities for authorized users. While
            lacking actual database connections, it demonstrates typical admin panel functionality through simulated
            data and operations.</p>

        <h4>Dashboard Analytics</h4>
        <p class="indent">The admin dashboard displays metrics including total orders, revenue figures, and product
            statistics. These values derive from hardcoded data or calculations based on stored orders in localStorage.
            Charts visualize trends and patterns using the Chart.js library, which renders interactive graphs from data
            arrays. Export functionality allows downloading reports in various formats.</p>

        <h4>Content Management</h4>
        <p class="indent">Administrators can view product listings, examine order details, and access customer
            information through the dashboard interface. While these operations don't modify underlying databases (since
            none exist), they demonstrate information presentation and interface organization typical of production
            admin panels. This simulation provides valuable experience with content management patterns and user
            interface design for administrative users.</p>

        <h2>4.5 Security Considerations</h2>
        <p class="indent">Despite operating entirely client-side, DecorHome implements basic security practices
            demonstrating awareness of common vulnerabilities and protection strategies. These practices would require
            significant enhancement for production deployment but serve educational purposes effectively.</p>

        <h3>4.5.1 Input Validation</h3>
        <p class="indent">All form inputs undergo validation before processing. Client-side validation provides
            immediate feedback preventing obviously invalid submissions. Email fields verify proper format. Required
            fields check for content presence. Numeric inputs ensure appropriate value ranges. While client-side
            validation enhances user experience, production systems require server-side validation as well since
            client-side checks can be bypassed.</p>

        <h3>4.5.2 Data Sanitization</h3>
        <p class="indent">User-provided content undergoes sanitization before display to prevent cross-site scripting
            attacks. JavaScript functions escape HTML special characters in user input, preventing malicious scripts
            from executing. This protection guards against attackers injecting JavaScript through form fields that later
            displays to other users.</p>

        <h3>4.5.3 Session Handling</h3>
        <p class="indent">Authentication state lives in sessionStorage rather than localStorage, automatically clearing
            when browser tabs close. This timeout behavior mimics server-side session expiration, reducing risk from
            unattended authenticated sessions. Production applications would implement additional protections including
            server-side session management, session timeouts, and secure token handling.</p>

        <p class="indent">The basic structure described throughout this chapter establishes DecorHome's technical
            foundation. Each technology contributes essential capabilities: HTML provides structure and semantics, CSS
            delivers visual presentation and responsive layouts, JavaScript enables interactivity and data management.
            Together with simulated backend functionality through browser storage APIs, these technologies create a
            complete e-commerce demonstration platform suitable for educational purposes and portfolio presentation.</p>

        <h2>5.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p class="indent">Testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle that ensures the quality,
            reliability, and functionality of the application. For the DecorHome project, a comprehensive testing
            strategy has been implemented to validate the various components and features of the e-commerce platform.
            This chapter outlines the testing approach, methodologies, and results for ensuring the DecorHome website
            meets the specified requirements and provides a seamless user experience.</p>

        <p class="indent">The testing process for DecorHome encompasses multiple levels, from unit testing of individual
            functions to integration testing of combined modules and validation of user workflows. Given that this is a
            client-side application, the testing focuses primarily on frontend functionality, user interface behavior,
            data persistence, and cross-browser compatibility.</p>

        <h2>5.2 Testing Workflow Diagram</h2>
        <p class="indent">The testing workflow illustrates the systematic approach used to validate the DecorHome
            application. Testing progresses through distinct phases, each building upon the results of previous stages
            to ensure comprehensive coverage of system functionality and reliability.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="indent">The testing workflow begins with unit testing, where individual functions and components are
            validated in isolation. Each function is tested with multiple test cases to ensure correct behavior under
            various conditions. When all unit tests pass, the workflow advances to integration testing, which examines
            how different modules interact and work together. This phase identifies issues that may not be apparent when
            testing components individually.</p>

        <p class="indent">Following successful integration testing, validation testing confirms that the application
            meets specified requirements and behaves correctly from the user's perspective. This includes functional
            validation, usability testing, accessibility checks, and responsive design verification across different
            devices. Database validation ensures proper data persistence through localStorage and sessionStorage
            mechanisms, while performance testing measures load times, resource usage, and cross-browser compatibility.
            Only when all testing phases pass successfully is the application deemed ready for deployment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h2>5.3 Unit Testing Process</h2>
        <p class="indent">Unit testing focuses on individual functions and methods to verify they produce expected
            outputs for given inputs. This granular approach helps identify bugs early in the development process when
            they are easier and less costly to fix.</p>

        <h2>6.1 Limitation</h2>
        <p class="indent">The DecorHome project, while comprehensive in its implementation of an e-commerce platform,
            has several inherent limitations due to its frontend-only architecture and educational nature. Understanding
            these limitations is crucial for future development and real-world application.</p>

        <h3>6.1.1 Current System Limitations</h3>
        <p class="indent">The current implementation faces multiple constraints across technical, functional, and
            performance domains. These limitations stem primarily from the client-side architecture and the educational
            scope of the project.</p>

            <p class="figure-title">Figure 6.1: System Limitations Overview</p>
        </div>

        <p class="indent">The technical limitations represent the most significant constraints. The client-side only
            architecture restricts data persistence to browser storage mechanisms, creates security vulnerabilities due
            to the inability to properly protect sensitive information, and limits scalability as all processing occurs
            in the user's browser. The absence of backend functionality means payment processing can only be simulated,
            user authentication lacks proper security measures, and inventory management cannot be synchronized across
            users.</p>

        <p class="indent">Functional limitations affect the user experience and administrative capabilities. User
            management lacks enterprise features like password recovery and granular permissions. The product system
            relies on static content and does not support user reviews or advanced filtering. Administrative controls
            are basic, with simulated analytics rather than real data-driven insights. Performance limitations manifest
            in longer initial load times due to large JavaScript files and lack of code splitting, runtime performance
            issues from extensive DOM manipulation, and SEO challenges inherent to client-side rendering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h2>6.2 Future Plan</h2>
        <p class="indent">Despite its current limitations, the DecorHome project has significant potential for
            enhancement and expansion. The following future plans outline the roadmap for transforming this educational
            project into a production-ready e-commerce platform.</p>

        <h3>6.2.1 Development Roadmap</h3>
        <p class="indent">The development roadmap is structured into three distinct phases: short-term goals focusing on
            backend integration and security, medium-term goals addressing advanced features and performance
            optimization, and long-term goals targeting platform expansion and artificial intelligence integration.</p>

        <p class="indent">The short-term phase establishes the foundation for a production system by implementing
            server-side development with Node.js and Express, creating a MongoDB database for persistent storage, and
            integrating proper authentication mechanisms. Security enhancements include OAuth 2.0 for social logins,
            two-factor authentication, and SSL/TLS encryption. Payment integration with Stripe and PayPal enables real
            transaction processing. The medium-term phase enriches user experience through wishlists, review systems,
            and personalization features while providing administrators with real-time analytics and content management
            capabilities. Performance optimization through framework migration and caching improves system
            responsiveness. The long-term phase transforms DecorHome into a comprehensive platform with multi-vendor
            marketplace features, native mobile applications, and artificial intelligence capabilities for enhanced user
            engagement and operational efficiency.</p>

        <p class="indent">Critical priority features form the foundation of a functional e-commerce platform and must be
            implemented first. Backend API development and database setup provide the infrastructure for data management
            and persistence. User authentication ensures secure access control, while payment system integration enables
            actual transactions. High priority features enhance user engagement and administrative oversight through
            review systems, real-time analytics, and performance optimization. Medium priority features differentiate
            the platform through wishlists, personalized recommendations, and social features. Low priority advanced
            features expand the platform's capabilities for marketplace functionality, mobile presence, and artificial
            intelligence integration.</p>
